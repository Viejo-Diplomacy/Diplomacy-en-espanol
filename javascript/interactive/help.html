        <h1>Help: InteractiveMap</h1>
        <table border="1">
            <tr><td>Requirements:</td><td>A browser that supports HTML5.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>How to:</td><td>To use the InteractiveMap-Interface you first have to activate it via the "activate IA"-Button above the map.</br>
                    Then simply select a unit by clicking on it's occupied territory. Next select the order you want to give with one 
                    of the buttons next to the "activate IA"-/"deactivate IA"-Button. Depending on the order type you selected you 
                    probably have to select one or more other territories to complete your order. You will find detailed information 
                    below this text.</br>
                    If you want to start a new order, but have not finished the order before, click on the "Reset-Order"-Button before you start the new order. 
                    In the "Order-Line" there should appear "-NEXT ORDER-".</br>
                    You can deactivate the InteractiveMap-Interface at any time.</br>
                    After you have set your orders, you have to save them as normal. ALWAYS check if there are incomplete orders which won't be saved!</br>
                    You can enter orders via the drop-down lists at any time. To let them appear on the map, make sure the InteractiveMap-Interface is activated
                    and click on "Reset-Order"-Button. The "Reset-Order"-Button will always redraw the order-arrows with the information set in the drop-down lists.</br>
                </td></tr>
            <tr><td>HOLD:</td><td>Select the unit that should hold and press the "HOLD"-Button.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>MOVE:</td><td>Select the unit that should move, press the "MOVE"-Button and select the territory the unit should move to.</br>
                    If you have selected a fleet that should move to a territory with two or more coasts that can be reached by the fleet, try to click on the coast
                    the fleet should move to. Perhaps you have to try different points until you get the move you wanted. You could also set it via the drop-down list.
                    Note that the selected coast is detected by the distance to the coast-coordinates (the positions of the territory where fleets at coasts are placed).</br>
                    If an army could reach the target territory "via convoy" or "via land", "via convoy" is set.</br>
                    The normal movement-rules still apply!
                </td></tr>
            <tr><td>SUPPORT HOLD:</td><td>Select the unit that should support another unit holding, press the "SUPPORT HOLD"-Button and select the supported unit.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>SUPPORT MOVE:</td><td>Select the unit that should support another unit moving, press the "SUPPORT MOVE"-Button, select the target territory and THEN the origin territory.</br>
                    IMPORTANT: Not that the order for the supported unit is changed as well, if it was different before and if it is one of your own units. This is unlike the normal way to set the orders!</br>
                    If the supported unit could move "via convoy" or "via land", "via land" is set. If "via convoy" is set before, it will stay "via convoy" as the MOVE-Order has not been different before.</br> 
                    Note that the same rules for fleets moving to coasts apply as with the MOVE-Order.
                </td></tr>
            <tr><td>CONVOY:</td><td>The way to set the CONVOY-order via InteractiveMap-Interface differs most from the normal way:</br>
                    First select the army that should be convoyed, press the "CONVOY"-Button, then select the convoying fleets in the correct order and finally select the target territory of the army.
                    The orders for the army and every fleet involved in the convoy will be set automatically, if they are your units.</br>
                    This is the only time, you can select a foreign unit before you give an order via a button. This will be necessary if you want to order your fleets to convoy a foreign unit from X to Y.
                </td></tr>
            <tr><td>REATREAT / DISBAND:</td><td>...</td></tr>
            <tr><td>BUILD / DESTROY</td><td>...</td></tr>

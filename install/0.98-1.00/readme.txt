This is the 1.00 release, based on our webDiplomacy's version number roughly reflecting the 
year (0.8x=2008, 0.9x=2009, etc), but also reflecting the relative feature completeness. The 
project has many more features than the original aim for 1.00.

Unlike past 0.7x->0.80/0.8x->0.90 changes this 0.9x->1.00 change is a pretty standard bugfix 
release, mainly because, unlike 0.7x and 0.8x, 0.9x has had many significant feature additions.
The difference between 0.90 and 0.97 (Live/Anonymous games, client-side orders, Variants, etc) 
is much larger than 0.70 vs 0.78 and 0.80 vs 0.82.

Although it's date based it's still a milestone, so congrats to all involved for getting us 
here. Hopefully the next five years will be as fun as the first five.

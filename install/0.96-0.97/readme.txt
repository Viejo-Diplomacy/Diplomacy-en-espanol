0.97 adds variant support, a long requested feature allowing non-standard maps to be played. 

Changelog
---------
- New variants/ folder, with basic sample variants and a World variant contributed by gilgatex
- Database uses ID numbers for countries and territories
- Database stores mapIDs for territories and borders
- All game-related objects are requested from a Variant object which is specific to that variant, 
	enabling the variant to return modified objects which implement different functionality.
- Certain previously classic-Europe-map oriented code has been generalized for variant support.
- JavaScript code updated to allow variant support. Convoys are now generated by the client 
	JavaScript and sent to the server along with other order data to be validated, removing the 
	need for regenerating all possible convoys, improving efficiency.
- Updated DATC test code to be more user-friendly and compatible with extra browsers
- Updated DATC results page to look better and have easier navigation, plus thumbnailed zoomed images of 
	the test case maps
- Added test cases to generate images for the intro page, and a custom test-case to test very 
	large convoy sizes.
- Updated forum, private message, game notice and home game-panel code to prevent issues with certain 
	browsers displaying columns incorrectly when rendering text wider than the columns.
- Added thumbnail support to map code
- webDiplomacy initial database no longer contains data specific to the classic variant, which is 
	installed via the variant installation script
- A confirmation dialog is shown when a user navigates away from a page when they have an 
	unsubmitted message
- JavaScript tweaks/updates to FAQ, New game, DATC, Forum and Home pages, allowing some 
	static HTML to be shown/hidden without a refresh, and letting highlighting game panels/notices
	that a user is hovering over on the Home page

Updating
--------
- Take a backup (database and files) <-- Important!
- Set the server to maintenance mode (perhaps set an appropriate message warning users of the update in config.php first)
- Wait a minute for all active processes to finish
- Unpack the new code, copy config.sample.php to config.php, and enter the correct config details from the old config.php
- Move the old code into a folder which can't be accessed from the web
- Run update.sql (for this update, on large servers, this may take a very long time because of the fundamental database changes required)
- Copy the new code where the old code used to be
- View and test the updated site
- Rerun the DATC tests, they will have been reset since certain things have changed
- Turn maintenance mode off

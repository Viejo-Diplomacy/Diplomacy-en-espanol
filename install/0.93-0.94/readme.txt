0.94 adds client-side order generation and updates some map code, to fix bugs, reduce 
server load, prepare for future variants and translations, and make things quicker for users.

Changelog
---------
- The prototype and scriptaculous libraries are included in contrib/ .

	- The DATC tests have been updated to test against the new JavaScript code.

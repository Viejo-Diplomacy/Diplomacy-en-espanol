0.96 improves stability for games by allowing extra checks before processing, making up for 
any downtime automatically detected and allowing rules regarding people who don't submit orders 
(e.g. whether to continue anyway or always wait).
Cacheing is also improved, with forum message icons now displaying dynamically, allowing forum 
HTML to be cached.

PSD for header and footer has been added. The font has also been included. Make sure to drop that into your font folder to install. Use our forums for support at http://www.audentio.com/forums

YOU DO NOT NEED TO USE HEADER.PSD. YOU CAN UPLOAD A .PNG IF YOU DESIRE. FOR BROWSER (IE6 and below) COMPATIBILITY, I HAVE INCLUDED IT ANYWAYS.

If you would like professional customization, please visit: audentio.com

If it is a simple text change or small modification, we will do it on us. However, we also can take this skin and completely customize it for you. To do this, please visit: http://www.audentio.com/request.php (copy into your address bar and go!)

Thank you,
